SHELL.FM RELEASE NOTES 0.7 - 2008-08-30

Changes:
 * Added "screen-format" option to set GNU screen window titles on track change.
 * When "term-format" is set to a format string, shell-fm will set the terminals window title on track-change now.
 * When option "download" is set to a path including format flags, free tracks are saved and tagged (with taglib support)
 * Prompt for radio URI on startup if no default radio is set and no URI is given as command line argument.
 * Added "gap" option for sleeping between tracks.
 * Added delayed quit ('q', works only if delay-change is set).
 * Delay of station changes works for bookmarks now.
 * Bookmark list is sorted.
 * Empty station cancels delayed station change.
 * $SHELL_FM_HOME is used as base directory instead of ~/.shell-fm/, if set.
 * Add pp-cmd that runs after a track is saved.
 * Small playback buffer to decrease CPU load when playing without libao.
 * Disable RTP at startup if "no-rtp" is set to something in the configuration.
