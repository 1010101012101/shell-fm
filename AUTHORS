NOTE: I've removed the information about who did what, since during the
development almost everything anyone added has been changed/replaced at some
time by me or others and it's impossible to track everything. So I'll just list
all the names of the people who contributed something at some time here. Of
course the details are still in the subversion commit log.

Please mail me (jonas.kramer@gmail.com) if your name is missing here.
If you want to praise or blame a developer for something particular,
search the SVN log.
